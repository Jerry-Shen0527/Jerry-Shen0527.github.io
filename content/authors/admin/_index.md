I am currently a third year Master student at [Geometry Computing Lab](http://gcl.ustc.edu.cn/) of University of Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/) and Prof. [Beibei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/). I major in applied mathematics and my research interest lies in computer graphics and computational imaging. I am looking to combine computer graphics techniques with computational holography to create algorithms for the next generation display equipments.
