I am currently a first year PhD student at [WeLight Lab](https://hku.welight.fun/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by Prof. [Evan Peng](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~evanpeng/). Previously to that, I did my Master study at [Geometry Computing Lab](http://gcl.ustc.edu.cn/) of [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/) and Prof. [Beibei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/). My research interest lies in computer graphics and computational imaging. I am looking to combine computer graphics techniques with computational holography to create algorithms for the next generation display equipments.
