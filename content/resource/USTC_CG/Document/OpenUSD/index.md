# Introduction & Motivation
This year, we hope to introduce content related to geometric computation, physical simulation, and rendering in our course. We aim to accomplish this using a unified file format and framework. We want our framework to be sufficiently flexible and scalable, which is why we are utilizing the file format and a series of peripheral components provided by OpenUSD. We hope that this step will allow us to align with industrial standards to a certain extent.
